    "\n",
    "Learn to interact with NOMAD Oasis via API, using the Python `requests` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can practice using NOMAD with the example NOMAD Oasis provided by FAIRMat: https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/oasis/gui/search/entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following actions:\n",
    "- Get an access token\n",
    "- Create a dataset for grouping uploads\n",
    "- (Optional) Get a list of all the datasets\n",
    "- Upload some test data to NOMAD\n",
    "- Check the Upload status\n",
    "- Show the metadata for your Upload\n",
    "- Update the metadata for your Upload: add coauthor(s), references, and other comments, as well as link to a dataset\n",
    "- Perform a search query (get help from the NOMAD Oasis GUI)\n",
    "- Download all the files for a given Upload_id\n",
    "- (Optional) Get your colleague's user information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you feel confident\n",

    "We have prepared some simple python functions to facilitate use of this API, you can find them in the `NOMAD_APY.py` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carefully read through and understand what each function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once youâ€™ve familiarized yourself with the functions, import the script and use them in your code to complete the exercises.\n",
