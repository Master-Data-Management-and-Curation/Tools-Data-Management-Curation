The driving source for HHG is a few-cycle Mid IR Optical Parametric Amplifier (MIR-OPA) that generates mid-infrared pulses tunable from 3 to 10 μm. The harmonics can be generated in transmission or reflection geometry and are acquired in the 1000 nm - 40 nm spectral range. The samples can be mounted on a motorized rotational stage for characterizing the harmonic response as a function of the sample orientation, and a broadband polarimeter allows the full characterization of the harmonics polarization state in the visible range. Furthermore, we can conduct time-resolved measurements (TR-HHG) by pumping the crystal under investigation with pulses at 1030 nm, 515 nm visible/NIR wavelengths and with the MIR-OPA.

This setup enables broadband pump-probe experiments to study the excitation dynamics of samples with high sensitivity. The sample can be photoexcited by either the laser's fundamental wavelength at 1030 nm, its second harmonic at 515 nm, and its third harmonic at 343 nm. Additionally, a tunable OPA within the range of 600 nm to 950 nm can be exploited. The time resolution of the experiments is 100 fs.

The optical system is designed to write structures down to 1 μm at a speed of 50 mm²/min directly into photoresist, without the need for a photomask. The elimination of photomasks from the lithographic process will increase the flexibility and significantly shorten the prototyping or manufacturing cycle. The MLA100 is controlled by an exposure wizard (GUI), which guides the operator through the complete procedure: Load the substrate, select the design and start the exposure. Applications for the MLA100 include Life Science, MEMS, Micro-Optics, Semiconductor, Sensors, Actuators, MOEMS, Material Research, Nano-Tubes, Graphene, and any other application that requires microstructures. The system can handle up to 8 inches x 8 inches substrates and can be also used for the production of photomasks, starting from Cr-coated mask blanks, which can then be operated by standard mask aligners.
